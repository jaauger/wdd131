        <p>Sunlight hits the solar cells: The panels are made of photovoltaic (PV) cells, typically silicon, which are treated to create two layers: one with a negative charge and one with a positive charge.
Electrons are knocked loose: When photons from sunlight hit the silicon, they energize and knock electrons out of the silicon atoms.
An electric field is created: The specially treated silicon layers create an electric field that forces these free electrons to flow in a single direction.
DC electricity is generated: This flow of electrons is a direct current (DC) electricity, which is collected by metal plates and wires within the panel.
Inverter converts the power: The DC electricity travels to an inverter, which converts it into alternating current (AC) electricity, the standard type used by most homes and businesses.
Power is supplied to your home: The AC electricity then flows to your home's electrical panel to be used for lights, appliances, and other devices. </p>
